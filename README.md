Word_Frequency_Analyzer
Short program I wrote for my Linear Algebra class to quickly analyze the frequencies of different words in a .txt document.

This short project introduced me to a few new concepts in programming:

Using python dictionaries to easily analyze frequencies of different words in a text.
Becoming more familiar with the CSV library in Python and text parsing in general.
Becoming more familiar with command line arguments in Python.
Description:

A short program I wrote to assist in a linear algebra project which quickly and easily analyzed the frequencies of words in a given text. It takes an input file which was a .txt, and outputs a sorted csv file which contains a predetermined number of words and their frequencies. The program is run the following way: ~python3 word_freq.py <input_file.txt> <output_file.csv> <number_of_words>
