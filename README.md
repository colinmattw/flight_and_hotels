This project introduced me to a few new concepts in programming as well refined existing ones:
1. Using OS based macros in Python
2. Using Selenium in Python for web automation
3. Extensive regex usage with HTML
4. Google Chrome developer tools to identify information in web pages
5. Using ChatGPT to create hard-to-obtain datasets
6. More practice with data pre and post-processing


Description:
A short program I wrote to assist in a linear algebra project which quickly and easily analyzed the frequencies of words in a given text. It takes an input file which was a .txt, and outputs a sorted csv file which contains a predetermined number of words and their frequencies. The program is run the following way: ~python3 word_freq.py <input_file.txt> <output_file.csv> <number_of_words>
